# Homework 1

Contained in this repo is your first homework assignment, where you will go through the Python notebook and follow the given steps, answering the questions that are asked throughout. For extra credit, you can implement a fair deep learning model and evaluate its results.

## Running Instructions:
To run this notebook, you can either use Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). If you use Google Colab, you will need to change this line in the second code cell: pio.renderers.default = "notebook_connected" to pio.renderers.default = "colab"
